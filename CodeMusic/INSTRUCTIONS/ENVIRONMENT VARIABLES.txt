How to set Environment Variables

If the Environment Variables are not set correctly, the Music++
system may not be able to run, returning an error regarding 
javac.  This is due to some of the calls that CoberCaller must
make in order to run cobertura properly.

First, ensure that the machine has the Java Developer's Kit installed.
Once it is installed, the environment variables need to be set to use
the path to the JDK in order to find the javac command.


Setting Environment Variables Through the Control Panel
	Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
	Click Path > Click Edit > Add Path to JDK to the FRONT of the path variable,
		separating it with a semicolon.  Do NOT delete the existing value in the
		variable; this is not necessary and may cause issues with your environment.
	>Click OK
	
	Click CLASSPATH > Click Edit > Add path to JDK to the front like with Path.
	
	The Path should be something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin
	with the x's replaced by the version of the jdk installed.
	

Setting Environment Variables Through the Command Line
	The environment variables can be set using the command line, although this option
	only temporarily changes the variable (it reverts once the cmd session closes).
	
	\CodeMusic > set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin;%PATH%
	\CodeMusic > set CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin;%CLASSPATH%
