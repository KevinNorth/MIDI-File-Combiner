To Run CodeMusic

To run the program from the windows cmd box, use the following command:

	\CodeMusic > java CodeMusic <file-name>
	
	file-name should be the name of a java program in the cobertura_bin
	directory.  It should be a correct java program-CodeMusic has no checks
	for input program correctness.  The argument does not need the .java
	file extension, only the file name.
	
To run the program from Eclipse, be sure the run configuration has <file-name>
as its argument.  The source code in eclipse will compile the .class files into
a directory called "bin", rather than the root CodeMusic directory.  Otherwise,
the directory structure is the same (See FILE STRUCTURE.txt for more information).
