Running CodeMusic from CMD

From CodeMusic Directory:
	
	>java CodeMusic <file-name>

file-name should be the name of a CORRECT java file
the file should be located in cobertura_bin

The file-name argument doesn't need the .java extension
	Currently the program assumes no extension in the argument


If trying to run CodeMusic and an error comes up regarding javac,
the environment variables of the system need to be set to be able
to locate javac.  See 'if javac not found' image for the command

The following environment variables can be set to help the system recognize javac,
	though PATH is the main one that has fixed the javac issue in the past:

PATH
CLASSPATH
JAVA_HOME

The Path is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin  (At the time of writing the jdk is version 1.7.0_55)

These can be set through Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
Put the path to the jdk in front of the existing values, separated by a semicolon
If setting these through the control panel to correct an issue with eclipse locating javac, eclipse
	needs to be restarted to show the changes

Alternatively, to temporarily set the variables through the command line, use the following commands:

	>set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin;%PATH%
	>set CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin;%CLASSPATH%
	>set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.x.x_xx\bin
